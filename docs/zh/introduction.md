## Support

If you run into any problems when using iro.js, feel free to contact me for help! The best way to get support is by [opening an issue thread on the iro.js Github repo](https://github.com/jaames/iro.js/issues), but you can also [email me](mailto:irojs@jamesdaniel.dev) or [send me a DM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rakujira).

## Motivation

I built iro.js after feeling pretty unsatisifed with the existing color picker widgets I came across while working on a project. They were either unintuitive, bloated, depended on extra libraries, or had been long-abandoned by their author.
