## Features

 * **Simple**: Low friction API, with robust support for hex, rgb, hsl and hsv color formats.
 * **Extendable**: Tweak the library to your requirements with [Plugins](/plugins.html) and custom UI elements
 * **Consistent behaviour**: Works across all modern browsers and devices, including touchscreens.
 * **Small footprint**: [7kb](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@jaames/iro) minified and gzipped, with absolutely no jQuery or extra css/images in sight.
 * **Great design**: The controls are designed to be intuitive and responsive, plus they're built with SVG so they look super crisp at any resolution.
 * **Transparency support**: Optional transparency slider with the [transparency plugin](https://github.com/jaames/iro-transparency-plugin).
 * **Licenced under MPL 2.0**: 100% free for personal and commercial use.

## Supporting the Library

I built iro.js after feeling unsatisifed with the existing color picker widgets I came across while working on a project. They were either unintuitive, bloated, dependant on external libraries, or had been long-abandoned by their author.

iro.js aims to solve all these problems, however maintaining and providing quality support for a library like this requires a lot of time and care. This is where you can help! 

By [donating](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=XS9R3QTLZYAXQ&source=url), you can ensure that I'm able to make iro.js the best color picker around, plus you also help support more rad open-source projects that are coming in the future :tada:

If you don't want to donate, [feature requests](https://github.com/jaames/iro.js/issues) and [contributions](https://github.com/jaames/iro.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) are always very much welcome, as is giving a star to the [project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/jaames/iro.js) or sharing it on social media!
